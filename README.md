## About
This is the HTML, CSS, JS for a weather forecast data using the data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org).
You can just type the city or a district name to convert them to weather and weather forecast data.

## Notes:
- This weather/weather forecast info maybe not correct to the weather right now.
- If you got a correct city name, but it says: "Cannot find the city name: `"${Your city}"`
to show the weather and weather forecast data." then check your internet was connected.
